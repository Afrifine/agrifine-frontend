### What was AgriFine's motivation as a company to build this application?


- With Zambias majority being significantly dependant on farming with over 70% of farmers in the country, with staple food as well as their day to day living leaning on farming. Agrifine saw it fit to  build an application that makes it easier for farmers to be more productive with the aid of technology so as to not be left behind on the global farming market and in Zambia as a nation.

### Why did AgriFine build this project?

 - The reason Agrifine build this project goes back to its mission statement "Making agriculture more efficient, productive, less costly and provide a reliable source of income to the youth". We believe this application will be a significant source of empowerment for not only farmers and aspiring farmers but for the youth alike if there is need for labor.

### What problem does it solve?

- The project is addressing some of the world's biggest challenges that are outlined in the SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS that is Poverty, Hunger and Good Health and Well being.

- SDG 1 No Poverty: Poverty levels in Zambia and Africa at large are soaring due to a high number of unemployed youths according to UNFPA. This project is made to help youths fine jobds on the app for those farmers and customers who might need man power on their fsrms thereby reducing the level of idleness and thus cresating employement.

- SDG 2 Zero Hunger: Hunger also is a major problem and it is reported that over 13,000 People die from hunger every day. As Agri-Fine Limited, by increasing productivity of farmers by educating them on the best methods of farming and rearing of animals, we will provide a platform for them to produce enough food for everyone in the country as well as surplus to export.
